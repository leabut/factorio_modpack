I know of at least one mod that contains an electric boiler:
[list]
[*] Alpha Mod (http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=87&t=7260)
[*] Steam Cycle Framework (http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=7859)[/list]
But they are much more involved mods.

What this mod is
[list]
[*] A ternary-powered electric boiler -- only run when solar power is available.
[*] Allows the user to store excess energy in hot water tanks instead of accumulator.[/list][/spoiler]

[spoiler=Version history][size=150]Version history[/size]
   - Version 0.11.1: Initial version based on regular pump/boiler.

   - Version 0.11.2: Simplify everything. Remove pumping code since the entity is already a pump.

   - Version 0.11.3: Fix a nasty bug because we incorrectly use table.remove()[/spoiler]

[spoiler=TODO][list]
[*]Balancing. Right now the mod is more of a proof-of-concept. I will need to play with it to get the efficiency right.
