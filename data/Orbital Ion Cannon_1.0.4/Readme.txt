Orbital Ion Cannon 1.0.4
========================

Version 1.0.4 was released November 23, 2015, was tested using Factorio v0.12.17, and was authored by Supercheese.

Do you have a large, late-game megabase and wish there were more cool things you could build? Do you wish you could do more with the rockets you launch than just increment a single number? Do you really hate biters? If so, then this mod is for you!
Build a giant ion cannon and launch it into orbit with a rocket, wait for it to charge up, and then you're ready to call down the thunder on those pesky aliens.
Simply click anywhere with your targeting device and watch the total annihilation ensue.
(If you've played the Command & Conquer series of games, you're bound to recognize many features similar to the GDI's Ion Cannons.)

You can click on the button added at the top of your screen to check on the status of your ion cannons in orbit.

This mod is aware of Bob's mods and will update its recipes and technology requirements if Bob's Warfare and/or Bob's Power mods are installed.

This mod also has configuration options available in config.lua. Here you may adjust the cooldown time for the ion cannons, their damage amounts and blast radii, toggle the "Ion cannon ready" etc. voices on/off, and choose to force off the recipe updates for Bob's mods.
